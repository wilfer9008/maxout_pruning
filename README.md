# Maxout pruning

This git contains the implementation in python using caffe of the paper "Neuron Pruning for Compressing Deep Networks Using Maxout Architectures"

## Abstract

This paper presents an efficient and robust approach for reducing the size of deep neural networks by pruning entire neurons. It exploits maxout units for combining neurons into more complex convex functions and it makes use of a local relevance measurement that ranks neurons according to their activation on the training set for pruning them. Additionally, a parameter reduction comparison between neuron and weight pruning is shown. It will be empirically shown that the proposed neuron pruning reduces the number of parameters dramatically. The evaluation is performed on two tasks, the MNIST handwritten digit recognition and the LFW face verification, using a LeNet-5 and a VGG16 network architecture. The network size is reduced by up to 74% and 61%, respectively, without affecting the networkâ€™s performance. The main advantage of neuron pruning is its direct influence on the size of the network architecture. Furthermore, it will be shown that neuron pruning can be combined with subsequent weight pruning, reducing the size of the LeNet-5 and VGG16 up to 92% and 80% respectively.
